    extendedDescription: "Wrote a 3D rendering engine from scratch in C++ with OpenGL. Implemented Blinn-Phong lighting with support " +
    "for specular, normal, and emission maps. Also implemented post-processing effects (bloom, HDR, blur), anti-aliasing, skyboxes, and " +
    "efficient model loading with face culling. I also ensured the system was modular and easily extensible for future features.",

    extendedDescription: "Made a constraint based 2D physics engine using C++ and OpenGL. Used concepts from linear algebra, multivariable calculus, " + 
    "and physics to create accurate physics simulations. Learned about Projected Gauss-Seidel, sequential impulses, and various other techniques " + 
    "such as warm starting, block solvers, and fixed timesteps. Made a collision detection program capable of detecting collisions and generating " +
    "contact points between any two convex polygons, a polygon and a ray, and a polygon and a point Used algorithms and data structures such as the " +
    "separating axis theorem, digital differential analyzer, and spatial hash grids.",
